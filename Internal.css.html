<h1>WHO CAN GIVE SADAQA'?</h1>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone can give sadaqa' for any amount. Some of the companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him) were incredibly generous in giving sadaqa, often giving away large portions of their wealth and keeping only enough to meet their needs. A good balance for us may be to divide our wealth between that which we need, savings and sadaqa'.
