<p style="text-align:justify;">Sadaqa' (charity) is charity given voluntarily in order to please God.<br>

Sadaqa' also describes a voluntary charitable act towards others, whether through generosity, love, compassion or faith. These acts are not necessarily physical or monetary. Simple good deeds such as a smile, or a helping hand, are seen as acts of sadaqa'. <br></p>
